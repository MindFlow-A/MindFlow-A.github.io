        <h1>Our Research</h1>
        <p>The history of artificial intelligence began in the 20th century, but its concept dates back to Ancient Greece (12th century BCE to 4th century CE). <br> At that time, there were already discussions about the possibility of creating an artificial entity capable of performing human tasks. <br> Although the earliest machines were designed for military purposes, they reinforced the idea that engineering could be capable of carrying out <br>complex tasks like a human. Then, in 1943, psychologist Walter Pitts and cybernetics specialist Warren McCulloch proposed a simplified<br> mathematical model to illustrate how the human brain works. This concept laid the foundation for studies on algorithms and deep learning.</p>
        <h5>Here are some aplications of AI in our society:</h5>
        <p>Health: Faster and more accurate diagnoses, as well as robot-assisted surgeries, which increase precision.
          <br>Industry: Higher production.          
          <br>Transport: Autonomous cars (Tesla) use AI for safe navigation.
          <br>Commerce: Chatbots provide 24-hour customer service.</p> 
        <h2>AI in Psychotherapy and Mental Health</h2>
        <p>AI-powered chatbots and virtual therapists are becoming more prevalent, providing users with accessible mental health support. <br>For instance, platforms like Character.ai offer bots that simulate therapy sessions, making mental health assistance available 24/7.</p>
    <h3>AI and Diagonostic in Psychology</h3>
    <p>AI algorithms analyze data such as text, images, and speech patterns to assist in diagnosing mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia.<br>
      AI models have achieved up to 92% accuracy in predicting suicide attempts and highlighting their potential in critical mental health interventions. </p>

    <h4>AI and Emotion Recognition</h4>
    <p>According to the World Health Organization, nowadays, AI systems are being developed to analyze facial expressions, voice tones, <br>and behaviors to understand emotional states, supporting psychological interventions.
      AI is progressing even more towards <br>recognizing emotions through voice analysis and gesture recognition, aiming to interpret the emotions they represent.<br>
      Besides that, ensuring accuracy in diverse cultural contexts and individual differences remains a significant challenge.</p>

      <p>
      According to the American Psychological Association, when it comes to AI, "psychologists have the expertise to question assumptions <br>about new technology and examine its impact on users".
 
      Psychologists apear to be taking close attention to the interaction <br>between humans and machines to understand how people perceive AI and what ripple effects such perceptions could have across <br>our modern society.
       
      A study found that "people are less morally outraged by gender discrimination caused by an algorithm <br>as opposed to discrimination created by humans." Which can be scary, and may increase the level of discrimination <br>in the world, maybe even destroying all the progress in that sector.</p>
      <h6>Our Opinion:</h6>
      <p>AI has significant potential to enhance mental health care by making psychological support more accessible and efficient. <br>However, its implementation must be carefully managed to address ethical issues, ensure patient privacy, and maintain the human element of therapy.<br>
        AI should serve as a complementary tool, augmenting traditional psychological care rather than replacing it.</p>
